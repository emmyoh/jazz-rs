# `jazz-rs`

## Overview
This is an unofficial, partial Rust implementation of [Jazz](https://jazz.tools/).

### Motivation
This repository exists to aid me in learning the TypeScript implementation of Jazz so that I may contribute to it.
My mental model of a codebase is incomplete unless I can address all of the issues that the Rust compiler forces me to consider;
the code in this repository is, essentially, a representation of my understanding of the TypeScript implementation of Jazzâ€”nothing more.
This *is not* an accurate implementation of Jazz, nor is it intended to be.

### Progress
Broadly speaking, a lot is currently missing, including:
- Tests & documentation
- CoValues
- Groups
- Synchronisation
- Loading & subscribing

So, pretty much everything.

All that you'll find here at the moment is some of the Jazz data model and cryptographic utilities.
